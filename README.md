## Overview
This is my first completed Challenge on Frontend Mentor which is the Qr code component challenge.



### Links

- Solution URL: Github pages
- Live Site URL: QrCode.github.io

## My process
Firstly, i studied the looks of the actual design of the Qr code provided by Frontend Mentor, when i had a clear plan of how i wanted to approach the challenge , i used HTML5 markup to start the structuring of the challenge , After the structuring ; i then proceeded to the designing using the necessary Css styles and properties needed to make it look close as the design Frontend Mentor provided

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I learnt how to use some new css styles properly ; like the text_-align property to center texts and also the margin property to center divs


```css
#qr-code {
  margin-left:auto;
  margin-right:auto
}
.middle{
  text-align: center;
}


### Continued development

  I still need to get better with my layout skiils and positioning of elements 


### Useful resources
